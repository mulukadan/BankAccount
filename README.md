# Triangle Tracker
This  a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:

- Equilateral: All sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
- Scalene: No sides are equal.
- NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
